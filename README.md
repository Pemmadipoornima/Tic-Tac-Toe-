# Tic-Tac-Toe-Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol—either X or O—with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

This Python project recreates the game using basic programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and lists, making it a great beginner-level project for learning how to build interactive console applications.
